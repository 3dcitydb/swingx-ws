/**
 * <p>A java.util.List containing the list of search results. This List is generally
 * constructed by the various YahooSearch subclasses during the readResults() phase
 * of the search. It is not thought generally useful to create instances of this
 * class yourself.</p>
 *
 * <p>ResultsList differs from java.util.List in that it adds two methods:
 * {@link #getTotalResultsAvailable} and
 * {@link #getFirstResultPosition}. The values returned from this method are
 * typically based on search results.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, suppose a search is performed that includes 100 results but
 * only the results between 30(inclusive)-40(exclusive) are included. The results from these methods
 * would be:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>getTotalResultsAvailable() = 100</li>
 *   <li>getFirstResultPosition() = 30</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p>None of these values are required for using this List. Rather, they are useful
 * when used to page through all of the totalResultsAvailable.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface adds one more important method, {@link #getYahooSearch()} which
 * returns the {@link YahooSearch} that was used to produce this search ResultsList.
 * This allows some automated code to page through all the results, creating new
 * searches as necessary.</p>
